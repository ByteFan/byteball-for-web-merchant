# byteball-for-web-merchants
Byteball for web merchants is a payment gateway between your web merchant site and the Byteball network. 

## Main feature
With Byteball for web merchants you will be able to accept Byteball payments for any goods or services you sell on the internet. Your website will display a quick Byteball payment button similar to the well known Paypal button. Only one single click on the button is needed by your customer to pay you. It is easy to use, nothing to fill.

In a minute you will be able to accept Byteball payments from mobile or desktop customers holding a Byteball wallet at a minimal cost and effort.

It is a pure script implementation: nothing to install.

On top of that Byteball for web merchants is anonymous, you do not need to register with us.

## Download
Easy implementation, nothing to install, 100% script solution, platform wise independent.

See example.html for payment button integration and customization.
